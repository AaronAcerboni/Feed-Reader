# What's this?
Feed reader is a web feed reading app for the common android phone (v2.x). It aims to be simple feed reader without 
google reader reliance.

# Background

Feed reader is my chosen project for my mobile application development class. I chose 
to make a feed reader because of the lack of simple ad-free feed readers which don't rely on having a 
google reader account.
